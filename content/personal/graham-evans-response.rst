This is an open response to a letter from Graham Evans MP, a copy of which is
available on this site: http://www.owencampbell.me.uk/docs/GrahamEvansLetter.pdf

The letter was prompted by a tweet of mine which criticised his vote against an
amendment to the immigration bill: https://twitter.com/opcampbell/status/724915477655486464

I'll take the points made in the letter one by one and offer my response below.

  I'm sure you'll agree that social media is not an appropriate platform to
  discuss such sensitive issues particularly as there are a number of layers to
  consider

I don't agree at all. The issue is one of national importance and public in its
very nature. If there are matters which have influenced your vote and which are
not known to your constituents, they should be made public.

  I do note that your Twitter account makes reference to your being the District
  Commissioner for Mersey Weaver Scouts - can I assume from this that your posts
  and comments are made on behalf of Cheshire Scouts / The Scout Association and
  that you are voicing their policy and opinion?

Of course not. The account is quite obviously personal and any opinions are
entirely my own. Just in case it's somehow not clear to you, this site is also
personal and the opinions in this post are entirely my own.

If you wish to view the thoughts of Mersey Weaver Scout District,
Cheshire Scout County or the Scout Association, I refer your to their own Twitter
accounts @MerseyWeaver, @CheshireScouts and @UKScouting respectively.

  I also note that you follow and / or are followed by a number of scout related
  groups locally, including the County Commissioner, and I am concerned that you
  feel it appropriate to use four letter comments about issues such as customer
  service.

  Given that you are in a position of responsibility in respect of young people
  I would venture that you may wish to moderate the tone of your postings to the
  extent that they do not use offensive or inappropriate language.

I assume the tweet you're referring to is https://twitter.com/opcampbell/status/723462850723897345
where I describe the service from TPO Mobile as 'a bit crap.' It's hardly the
most offensive language and only the most petty-minded and fervent puritan would
use it to imply that I'm somehow corrupting the minds of the young.

  As a Scout Association Ambassador and a Member of the national Council, I would
  be most disappointed were your comments to be misconstrued and reflect on the
  good works done through scouting generally.

If you believe I'm failing to discharge my duties as District Commissioner, I
refer you to the Scout Association's complaints policy: http://members.scouts.org.uk/supportresources/3982
You already have the contact details for my County Commissioner to whom any
complaint should be addressed.

I'd also direct you to the Scout Promise where, amongst other things, we promise to do our best
to help other people.
