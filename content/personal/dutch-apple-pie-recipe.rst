After visiting Amsterdam and sampling the stunningly good apple pie at
`Cafe Papeneiland <http://www.papeneiland.nl/home.html>`_, I had to make it
myself when I returned home. There are many recipes online and, after trying
them out, here's what I've settled on.

Ingredients
-----------

For the filling
***************

* 1 kg apples,  Goudrenet is the traditional dutch variety. I use Bramleys. Granny Smith would probably be ok
* Juice of 1 medium-sized lemon, freshly squeezed
* 70 g caster sugar
* 2 tsp ground cinnamon
* 50 g sultanas

For the dough
*************

* 175 g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing the pan
* 175 g all-purpose flour
* 175 g self-raising flour
* 175 g caster sugar
* 1 large egg
* Â½ tsp lemon zest, freshly grated
* 1 Tbsp water
* Pinch of salt
* 3 Tbsp dried breadcrumbs

For the glaze
*************

* 70 g apricot jam
* 30 ml (2 Tbsp) brandy (or water)

Method
------
Put the sultanas in a small bowl along with a cup of hot water and let them soak for 15 minutes.

Prepare the filling
*******************
Add the lemon juice to a large bowl. Peeling, core and thinly slice the apples, placing them in the bowl as you go. Stir them around in the lemon juice, so that they don't discolour.
Drain the sultanas, squeeze them with your hands and add them to the bowl along with the sugar and cinnamon. Mix well with a wooden spoon or spatula. Set bowl aside.

Butter the bottom and sides of your spring-form pan generously.

Prepare the dough
*****************
Beat the butter, until softened and creamy, for 1-2 minutes. Sift all-purpose and self-raising flour directly into the bowl and add the sugar, salt, lemon zest, water and the egg. Mix all the ingredients with your hands and knead until you have a smooth, shiny, soft yet pliable dough that's not sticking to your hands.

Cut off a third of the dough and leave it aside.
Take the rest of the dough, shape it into a ball and place it in the middle of the spring-form pan. Using the back of your hand, press the dough over the bottom and up the sides of the pan. The dough should come up to 2/3 of the height of the pan. Try to spread the dough as evenly as possible.
Sprinkle the base of the pastry case with the dried breadcrumbs.
Mix the filling once more and then fill the pastry case.

Take the piece of dough you left aside and divide it into smaller pieces. Roll each piece into long, thin round strips and use them to decorate the tart, lattice style.

Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven and bake at 180 degrees for 45-50 minutes, until the crust takes on a golden-brown color.

Prepare apricot glaze
*********************
Ten minutes before the pie is ready, prepare the glaze by putting the apricot jam and the brandy (or water) in a small saucepan. Heat the jam over medium heat, until it comes to the boil and then immediately remove from the heat.

When the apple pie is ready, take it out of the oven and immediately glaze it, using a pastry brush. Allow the pie to slightly cool inside the pan and then remove the sides of the pan. Allow to cool completely and if you want, move the pie onto a platter or cake stand.
