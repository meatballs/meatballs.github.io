# About Me

I am a well-established Freelance Software Engineer & Consultant (MIET & CEng) with 30+ years' experience.

I'm UK based with clients around the world - of all sizes and in a wide variety of sectors, both public and private.

I'm a Python enthusiast, one of the [PyCon UK](http://pyconuk.org) organisers and a founding trustee of the [UK Python Association](https://uk.python.org).

## What I Do

I'm a consulting software engineer focused on improving the business world by purging it of spreadsheets.

I help organizations transition from error-prone spreadsheets to robust, maintainable software solutions using Python and modern web technologies.
