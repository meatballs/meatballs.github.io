# About Me

I am a well-established Freelance Software Engineer & Consultant (MIET & CEng) with 30+ years' experience.

I'm UK based with clients around the world - of all sizes and in a wide variety of sectors, both public and private.

I'm a Python enthusiast, one of the [PyCon UK](http://pyconuk.org) organisers and a founding trustee of the [UK Python Association](https://uk.python.org).

## What I Do

I'm a consulting software engineer who specialises in unique business challenges.

When a company's success comes from doing things differently, off-the-shelf software often can't help. These organisations end up relying on spreadsheets and manual systems that grow increasingly complex and fragile over time.

I build custom software they need - solutions that respect their existing processes while making them reliable, automated, and manageable.

I work with my family at [Empiria](https://empiria.co.uk), a small family development business. [Meet the team](https://empiria.co.uk/team/owen).
