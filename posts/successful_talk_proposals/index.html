Our 2022 Advice

we&rsquo;ll come back to again in a moment):</p><p><a href=https://anvil.works/blog/conference-talks-that-spark-joy target=_blank rel=noopener>Create a Conference Talk Proposal that Sparks Joy</a></p><p>I want to come at this from a slightly different angle. Rather than offering some
guidance on how to write a proposal, I thought I&rsquo;d look back at the proposals that have
stood out and see if I could spot any patterns. What is it that consistently makes our
review team give out their highest scores?</p><p>I&rsquo;ll be using several examples from PyCon UK 2022. This was our first conference after
COVID-19 and competition for places was fierce. The conference was scaled down compared
to previous years (we had 22 talk slots compared with 79 in 2019) yet the number of proposals
was higher (167 compared with 147 in 2019). To get on to our stage and give a talk in 2022,
the proposal had to be even better than usual.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what I found&mldr;</p><h2 id=personal-stories>Personal Stories</h2><p>We say it on our own guidelines and it&rsquo;s definitely true. If you can weave a story into
what you write, we&rsquo;ll remember it. If it&rsquo;s a personal story, even better.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a talk from Scott Irwin that told us he&rsquo;d started as a web developer novice
and how he&rsquo;d used a particular tool to learn and get better:</p><p><a href=https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/QZQXHA/ target=_blank rel=noopener>PyScript and my journey to the web</a></p><h2 id=metaphor>Metaphor</h2><p>We do seem to like a metaphor. They stick in the mind and the proposal immediately stands
out.</p><p>The master of the metaphorical talk is probably Daniele Procida. Here&rsquo;s his 2022 talk:</p><p><a href=https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/L3YEB3/ target=_blank rel=noopener>How to Wag a Dog</a></p><p>But, coming back to Hannah, the metaphor is what really sold her 2022 proposal to the reviewers
and led to her delivering our opening keynote that year:</p><p><a href=https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2022/talk/7ANG8N/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Unexploded Bombs</a></p><h2 id=hidden-worlds>Hidden Worlds</h2><p>If you can offer to tell our audience about a world they didn&rsquo;t even know existed,
you&rsquo;ll have our reviewers hooked. They&rsquo;ll want to know more and, to do that, they&rsquo;ll
score the proposal highly.</p><p>I&rsquo;m going to use a lightning talk as an example here. For those, you still have
to submit a written proposal - you just use an index card and a <a href=https://owencampbell.me.uk/posts/lightning_talks/>bucket</a> -
and those are reviewed and selected.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a great example of a talk that made it on to the stage by offering to show us
a world we knew nothing about:</p><p><a href="https://youtu.be/FFZHt_BPXXE?t=585" target=_blank rel=noopener>How to walk in a straight line</a></p><h2 id=track-record>Track Record</h2><p>Of course, one way to boost your proposal&rsquo;s chances is for the reviewers to remember
talks you&rsquo;ve given previously and want to hear more from you - but that&rsquo;s the subject of
