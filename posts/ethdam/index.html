I needed a project - something I could get coding, make it work and learn how this all works along the way.</p><p>And then my son, James, pointed me at <a href=https://www.ethdam.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>ETHDam</a> - a web3 conference with free tickets for anyone accepted into their hackathon. Given that he also had an idea for something we could work on together, it seemed the perfect opportunity.</p><p>So, off we went - me with no web3 experience and neither of us having ever participated in a hackathon. We had an absolute blast!</p><p>James had an idea for how we might build a voting system where:</p><ul><li>All votes are secret until the counting starts</li><li>Voter identity is always secret</li><li>Anyone can verify that all votes were cast by somebody eligible to do so</li><li>Anyone can verify that the count was correctly performed</li></ul><p>We wanted to see if we could build a proof of concept, hopefully show that his idea was sound, teach me a thing or two, make some contacts and generally enjoy ourselves.</p><p>We were joined by Kieran, one of James&rsquo; work colleagues, and the three of us spent a day and a half working on our project before submission to the judging panel on the final day of the conference.</p><p>We used two of the ETHDam partners&rsquo; products in our project - <a href=https://sismo.io target=_blank rel=noopener>sismo</a> for zero knowledge proof of eligibility and <a href=https://scroll.io target=_blank rel=noopener>scroll</a> for storing the encrypted votes - and so we entered ourselves for the bounties on offer from both of those organisations.</p><p>We also used condition based decryption by <a href=https://nucypher.com target=_blank rel=noopener>nucypher</a> and built our demo app using <a href=https://anvil.works target=_blank rel=noopener>anvil</a> .</p><p>Much to our amazement, we picked up a prize from both of the sponsors and went home with $3000 of bounty! James&rsquo; idea certainly is sound and we&rsquo;re not the only ones who thought so!</p><p>Given that using anvil was what I&rsquo;d brought to the party and it&rsquo;s not exactly a mainstream solution, I was delighted that we managed to build our demo in such a short time. It certainly proved itself that weekend - there is no other way I could have carried off $3000 in prize money by building an app in 36 hours in a field I&rsquo;d never worked in before.</p><p>ETHDam itself was wonderful. The organisers had done an excellent job and, as a hacker with my head down for hours at a time, I was well looked after. As a newcomer to this world, I couldn&rsquo;t have possibly been made more welcome and I&rsquo;ll certainly be back.</p><div class=footer><a href=https://github.com/meatballs>GitHub</a> /
